Documentation for OAKD (OpenCV AI Kit - D)

# OAK-D (OpenCV AI Kit - D)
OAK-D is a spatial AI powerhouse, capable of simultaneously running advanced neural networks while providing depth from two stereo cameras and color information from a single 4K camera in the center.

OAK-D have have a powerful Visual Processing Unit (VPU) that is **Intel Myriad X**, which give compute speed of 4 Trillion Ops/sec

**Applications using OAK-D** :
 - Social Distancing and Mask Detection.
 - 3D Reconstruction and Estimations.
 - Collision Detection for Unmanned Vehicles and other Vehicles.
 - 6D Human Posture Estimation and Gaze detection.
## DepthAI
DepthAI is a special C++ library created by Luxonis to work with OAK-D. DepthAI API is only provided for Python and C++ .
For more documentation, visit https://docs.luxonis.com/

### DepthAI - Python API
In Luxonis GitHub depthai-python repository, there are a brief explanation about different programs using OAK or OAK-D.

## Architecture
<a href="https://ibb.co/PwQyGSB"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/6gBS0d6/architecture.png" alt="architecture" border="0"></a>

This is a basic architecture of OAK camera Pipeline, which includes nodes for Camera, Neural Network and their communication linking.
### Pipeline
- Pipeline is the complete structure, which includes nodes and their connecting links.
- Generally, Pipeline contains 5 nodes and 4 links.
- After creating Pipeline, user needs to upload it to the device that is OAK device. 

### Input / Output Queue
- Input or Output at the end Xlink nodes is in a queue.
- Default Max Size of Queue = 30 and Non-Blocking Mode.
- There are 2 behaviors of Queue (Blocking and Non-Blocking).
- To use device for instant we use Max Size = 1 and Non-Blocking mode.
#### Blocking mode
In blocking mode, it blocks all new entry to the queue when it is full. 
#### Non-Blocking mode
In Non-Blocking Mode, it will erase to older entry in the queue to add newest when queue is full.

### Initialization and Uploading
Basic flow for initialization and declaration of Pipeline to OAK-D
 1. Declare Pipeline
 2. Define Pipeline : 
	- Create Nodes and Links
	- Define .blob models for neural network node
3. Upload Pipeline to Device (OAK-D)
